Practice for learning webrtc

Process to use the file

1. Clone the repo
2. Use live server extension, go live.
3. Open 2 windows of the same file to connect to each other
4. Create an offer from either one. The offer SDP will be copied automatically
5. Paste the (already copied) SDP in the other Join input box and click Join
6. Then paste the answer SDP (which again automatically copies to clipboard) in the send answer input
7. It is connected now (hopefully!)

Now you can send text from one side to other.
The side that created the offer needs to send from 1, and the side that joined needs to send from 2.
